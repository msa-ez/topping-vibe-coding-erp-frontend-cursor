# Metadata-Based Dynamic Component Structure
When creating the package structure in the first step of frontend-generation-rules, the following component structure must be followed.

      Loading.tsx
      Sidebar.tsx
    /[aggregate]/                   # Aggregate-level folder
      [Command]Modal.tsx            # Command modal (when isRestRepository: false)
