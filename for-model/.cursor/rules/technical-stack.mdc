When generating code, strictly adhere to the following frameworks, technologies, databases and utilities, architecture patterns and design methodologies.

Core Frameworks
1. Application framework based on Spring Boot 2.3.1.RELEASE
2. Development environment based on Java 11
3. Use Javax packages (javax.persistence.*, javax.transaction.*, etc.)

Main Technologies
1. Data access layer implementation through Spring Data JPA
   - H2 Database (runtime embedded DB)
   - Domain modeling based on JPA Entity
2. RESTful API exposure through Spring Data REST
   - Hypermedia-based API with HATEOAS support
3. Microservice communication through Spring Cloud Stream (Germantown.SR1 version)
   - Channel definition based on @Input/@Output annotations
   - Event reception through @StreamListener
   - Event publication through MessageChannel
4. DDD pattern implementation
   - Aggregate Root definition through @Entity
   - Repository pattern based on JpaRepository
   - Domain event-based communication
5. Lombok mandatory handling
   - @Data: Auto-generate getter, setter, toString, equals, hashCode
   - Version: 1.18.12

Test Methodology
Refer to @test-code-genetation-rules for detailed test implementation specifications.
1. Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD)
   - Unit testing using JUnit
   - Integration testing using Spring Test

Messaging and Event Processing
Refer to `@domain-event-publishing-rules` for messaging and event processing configuration
3. Maven dependency management
   - spring-cloud-starter-stream-kafka: Kafka binding
   - spring-cloud-dependencies (Hoxton.SR12)
   - spring-cloud-stream-dependencies (Germantown.SR1)

Architecture Patterns and Design Methodologies
1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
   - Domain modeling based on Event Storming
   - Aggregate Root: Core domain entity expressed with @Entity
   - Domain Event: Event class extending AbstractEvent
   - Repository: Extend JpaRepository interface
   - Loose coupling between services through domain events
2. Clean Architecture (Hexagonal Architecture)
   - domain package: Business logic and domain model
     - Aggregate Root Entity
     - Domain Event
     - Repository interface
     - Business methods (implemented as static methods)
   - infra package: External system integration adapters
     - Controller: Inbound adapter (REST API)
     - PolicyHandler: Inbound adapter (event reception)
     - AbstractEvent: Outbound adapter (event publication)
3. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
   - Asynchronous communication based on Pub/Sub pattern
   - Event sourcing: Utilize JPA Lifecycle Hooks (@PostPersist, @PostUpdate, etc.)
   - Event publication: Guarantee transaction consistency through publishAfterCommit()
   - Event reception: Selective subscription through @StreamListener + condition
4. Microservices Architecture (MSA)
   - Each service owns independent database (H2)
   - Automatic RESTful API exposure through Spring Data REST
   - Event-based communication between services through Kafka
   - Each service independently deployable (Docker + Kubernetes)
